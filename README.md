# Halloween - Hacktoberfest ![Level](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tech-HTML-orange.svg?longCache=true&style=for-the-badge)
Welcome to the Halloween Hacktoberfest challenge, designed with all skill levels in mind!

No matter what your skill level you can still contribute to this project. You could add some HTML, CSS, images, text content, documentation, fix typos... In short, if you see something you can add GO for it :)

The project has been created with a basic bootstrap template to kick things off. I have intentionally left things blank, so there is plenty of work to do. If you wish to add an extra section, for example, a costume section or a history of Halloween section. You are more than welcome to do so.

# What is Hacktoberfest?
Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-source software! All you have to do to take part is sign up on their website - https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ - and make five pull requests in the month of October. Any pull request to any public repo on Github will count, which means, of course, that any PRs you make to this project will help you on your way to getting a cool t-shirt!

# Instructions 
If you've never forked a repository or made a pull request before, we recommend making your first one over at https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines. That will count towards your total, and then you'll be ready to take on this challenge with your new GitHub skills!

Now, once you've forked this repo and got a local version up on your computer, you are ready to add some content to the project in any way you see fit.

Once you are done with your changes save it, and commit to your repo.

You will now need to ensure that you have an up to date copy of the project (someone else may have pushed to the repo since you cloned it). To do this you will need to sync your fork with the "upstream" (Upstream means the actual repository which you have forked to get a local version of the project). 

You can read more about synchronizing a fork at the following two links:
- https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/
- https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

Essentially you just need to run following 2 commands: 
1) `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git`
2) `git pull upstream master`
The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

Now it's time to make some contribution to the project. Go through the project files and if you think that something needs to be changed then apply the changes and save the file. After the changes have been made run the following git commands:

- git status
- git add .
- git commit -m "Changes made"
- git push

Now, go to your repo and make the Pull Request. Any member of the Management team will merge it whenever they are available.

Congratulations! You're nearly done, make sure you have made 5 pull requests to qualify for your free t-shirt. You can check how many qualifying pull requests you have made at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/stats/<YOUR-GH-NAME>
Have Fun and Happy Coding Guys!
